# Machine Translation Demo - Frontend

This repository contains the frontend components for the Machine Translation Demo project, which provides a web interface for translating text using the NiuTrans.SMT system.

## How to Run


1. Start the local web server:
   ```bash
   # Navigate to frontend directory
   cd frontend
   
   # Start Python simple HTTP server
   python -m http.server
   ```

2. Access http://localhost:8000 in your browser

3. Alternatively, you can open the `index.html` file directly in your browser (though this may be restricted by browser security policies).
